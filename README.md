# grownsmall

GrownSmall was a webstite I developed in 2012 as a new way to connect with local customers. It reached beta stage but attracted very little users.  I was closing down the server for other reason and therefor GrownSmall was shut down before it had time to start.  Recently there has been some interest in the idea so I am putting it on GitHub for updating and delvelopment.
GrownSmall offered farmers, gardeners and other crafters of artisanal ‘farm made’ goods an online store to showcase their products, track inventory, and take orders.
At the heart of the Grown Small system are cooperatives. Cooperatives allow smaller growers to band together to increase the variety of their offerings, improve marketing visibility and simplify the distribution of products.

*** Known Issues**
Currently the database structure is lost to histroy.  A database sturcure will have to rebuilt using clues from the code
I imaginged the website faciliating cash based sales, with growers buying a subsciption.  This seems antiquated and silly a new payment and monitization system will have to be implemented to replace the subsription model as it currently exists.
